    <h2>How We Process Messages</h2>
    <p>Messages submitted through the web interface are processed in-memory and never written to disk. Once the prediction response is returned, the raw text is discarded.</p>

    <h2>Internal Processing</h2>
    <p>Risk scoring is performed entirely within the SpamShield service. No external scoring providers or third-party endpoints receive message content.</p>

    <h2>Logging</h2>
    <p>Application logs capture only truncated message previews (first 50 characters) to assist with debugging. You can disable this behavior by adjusting the logging statements in <code>app.py</code>.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have compliance questions, raise an issue in the repository or reach out to your platform administrator for assistance.</p>
